/*
â˜• Problem: Repeated Coffee Orders
You are analyzing customer behavior at a coffee shop. Each customer order is represented by a single character in a string:

'E' = Espresso
'L' = Latte
'C' = Cappuccino
'M' = Mocha
'A' = Americano
You are given a string orders representing a sequence of coffee orders made throughout the day. Your task is to find all 5-order-long sequences that appear more than once in the string.

Example:
Input: orders = "ELCAMELCAMELCAME"
Output: ["ELCAM", "LCAME", "CAMEL"]

Constraints:
1 <= orders.length <= 10^5
orders contains only the characters 'E', 'L', 'C', 'M', 'A'
